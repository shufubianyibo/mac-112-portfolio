    "text": "8.1 Warm-up\n\nData Science Process\nBelow is the visual representation of the data science process we saw earlier. Which stage are we in currently?\n\nRecall that wrangling is important. It is much of what we spend our efforts on in Data Science. There are lots of steps, hence R functions, that can go into data wrangling. But we can get far with the following 6 wrangling verbs:\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\n\narrange\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\nfilter\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\nselect\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\nmutate\nmutate or create a column\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\ngroup_by\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Single Verb\nLet’s start by working with some TidyTuesday data on penguins. This data includes information about penguins’ flippers (“arms”) and bills (“mouths” or “beaks”). Let’s import this using read_csv(), a function in the tidyverse package. For the most part, this is similar to read.csv(), though read_csv() can be more efficient at importing large datasets.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\npenguins &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-07-28/penguins.csv')\n\n# Check it out\nhead(penguins)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nConstruct a plot that allows us to examine how the relationship between body mass and bill length varies by species and sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nUse the 6 wrangling verbs to address each task in the code chunk below. You can tack on |&gt; head() to print out just 6 rows to keep your rendered document manageable. Most of these require just 1 verb.\n\n\n\n# Get data on only Adelie penguins that weigh more than 4700g\n\n\n# Get data on penguin body mass only\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n# Sort the penguins from smallest to largest body mass\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n\n# Calculate the average body mass across all penguins\n# Note: na.rm = TRUE removes the NAs from the calculation\n\n\n\n# Calculate the average body mass by species\n\n\n\n# Create a new column that records body mass in kilograms, not grams\n# NOTE: there are 1000 g in 1 kg\n# Show just the first 6 rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nHow many penguins of each species do we have? Create a viz that addresses this question.\n\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nCan we use the 6 verbs to calculate exactly how many penguins in each species?\nHINT: n() calculates group size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount verb\n\n\n\nThe count() verb provides a handy shortcut!\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  count(species)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  species       n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie      152\n2 Chinstrap    68\n3 Gentoo      124\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Multiple Verbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck Understanding\n\n\n\nLet’s practice combining some verbs. For each task:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs. That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\nAsk what you can rearrange and still get the same result.\nRead your final code like a paragraph / a conversation. Would another person be able to follow your logic?\n\n\n\n\n# Sort Gentoo penguins from biggest to smallest with respect to their \n# bill length in cm (there are 10 mm in a cm)\n\n\n# Sort the species from smallest to biggest with respect to their \n# average bill length in cm\n\n\n\nExample 3: Interpret Code\nLet’s practice reading and making sense of somebody else’s code. What do you think this produces?\n\nHow many columns? Rows?\nWhat are the column names?\nWhat’s represented in each row?\n\nOnce you’ve thought about it, put the code inside a chunk and run it!\npenguins |&gt; filter(species == “Chinstrap”) |&gt; group_by(sex) |&gt; summarize(min = min(body_mass_g), max = max(body_mass_g)) |&gt; mutate(range = max - min)"

The right approach depends upon your research goals. A general rule is: Only get rid of observations with missing data if they’re missing data on variables you need for the specific task at hand!\n\n\nExample 1\nSuppose our research focus is just on body_mass_g. Two penguins are missing this info:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(body_mass_g))`\n                      &lt;int&gt;\n1                         2\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that removes these penguins:\n\n# NOTE the use of is.na()\npenguins_w_body_mass &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))\n\n# Compare the number of penguins in this vs the original data\nnrow(penguins_w_body_mass)\n\n[1] 342\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\nNote that some penguins in penguins_w_body_mass are missing info on sex, but we don’t care since that’s not related to our research question:\n\npenguins_w_body_mass |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(sex)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(sex))`\n              &lt;int&gt;\n1                 9\n\n\nExample 2\nIn the very rare case that we need complete information on every variable for the specific task at hand, we can use na.omit() to get rid of any penguin that’s missing info on any variable:\n\npenguins_complete &lt;- penguins |&gt; \n  na.omit()\n\nHow many penguins did this eliminate?\n\nnrow(penguins_complete)\n\n[1] 333\n\nnrow(penguins)\n\n[1] 344\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nExplain why we should only use na.omit() in extreme circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: More Selecting\nBeing able to select() only certain columns can help simplify our data. This is especially important when we’re working with lots of columns (which we haven’t done yet). It can also get tedious to type out every column of interest. Here are some shortcuts:\n\n- removes a given variable and keeps all others (e.g. select(-island))\nstarts_with(\"___\"), ends_with(\"___\"), or contains(\"___\") selects only the columns that either start with, end with, or simply contain the given string of characters\n\nUse these shortcuts to create the following datasets.\n\n# First: recall the variable names\nnames(penguins)\n\n[1] \"species\"           \"island\"            \"bill_length_mm\"   \n[4] \"bill_depth_mm\"     \"flipper_length_mm\" \"body_mass_g\"      \n[7] \"sex\"               \"year\"             \n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep everything but the year and island variables\npenguins_sub &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  select(-island, -year) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\nhead(penguins_sub)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g sex   \n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181        3750 male  \n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186        3800 female\n3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195        3250 female\n4 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193        3450 female\n5 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190        3650 male  \n6 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181        3625 female\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the penguin characteristics measured in mm\npenguins_sub &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  select(species,ends_with(\"mm\")) %&gt;% \n  na.omit()\nhead(penguins_sub)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7               181\n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4               186\n3 Adelie            40.3          18                 195\n4 Adelie            36.7          19.3               193\n5 Adelie            39.3          20.6               190\n6 Adelie            38.9          17.8               181\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and bill-related measurements\npenguins_sub &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  select(species, starts_with(\"bill\")) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\nhead(penguins_sub)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  species bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1          18.7\n2 Adelie            39.5          17.4\n3 Adelie            40.3          18  \n4 Adelie            36.7          19.3\n5 Adelie            39.3          20.6\n6 Adelie            38.9          17.8\n\n\n\n# Use a shortcut to keep only species and the length-related characteristics\npenguins_sub &lt;- penguins %&gt;%\n  select(species, contains(\"length\")) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\nhead(penguins_sub)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  species bill_length_mm flipper_length_mm\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie            39.1               181\n2 Adelie            39.5               186\n3 Adelie            40.3               195\n4 Adelie            36.7               193\n5 Adelie            39.3               190\n6 Adelie            38.9               181\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Arranging, Counting, & Grouping by Multiple Variables\nWe’ve done examples where we need to filter() by more than one variable, or select() more than one variable.

Dates are a whole special object type or class in R that automatically respect the order of time.\n\n# Get today's date\nas.Date(today())\n\n[1] \"2024-10-07\"\n\n# Let's store this as \"today\" so we can work with it below\ntoday &lt;- as.Date(today())\n\n# Check out the class of this object\nclass(today)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\nThe lubridate package inside tidyverse contains functions that can extract various information from dates. Let’s learn about some of the most common functions by applying them to today. For each, make a comment on what the function does\n\nyear(today)\n\n[1] 2024\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n# One of them produce numeric \"10\", and the other gives a categorical \"Oct\" with sequance.\nmonth(today)\n\n[1] 10\n\nmonth(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Oct\n12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec\n\n\n\n# What does this number mean?\n# It is the 40th week of the year.\nweek(today)\n\n[1] 41\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n# \"mday\" produce the day of month and, and \"yday\" produce the day of year.\nmday(today)\n\n[1] 7\n\nyday(today)  # This is often called the \"Julian day\"\n\n[1] 281\n\n\n\n# What do these lines produce / what's their difference?\n# The first one is numeric, and the second one is a categorical with sequence\nwday(today)\n\n[1] 2\n\nwday(today, label = TRUE)\n\n[1] Mon\nLevels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat\n\n\n\n# What do the results of these 2 lines tell us?\n# Our day is behind \"2024-02-14\", not before it.\ntoday &gt;= ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\ntoday &lt; ymd(\"2024-02-14\")\n\n[1] FALSE"

    "text": "8.3 Exercises Part 2: Application\nThe remaining exercises are similar to some of those on the homework. Hence, the solutions are not provided. Let’s apply these ideas to the daily Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package.\n\nlibrary(mosaic)\ndata(\"Birthdays\")\nhead(Birthdays)\n\n  state year month day       date wday births\n1    AK 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     14\n2    AL 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    174\n3    AR 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     78\n4    AZ 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed     84\n5    CA 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    824\n6    CO 1969     1   1 1969-01-01  Wed    100\n\n\nBirthdays gives the number of births recorded on each day of the year in each state from 1969 to 19881. We can use our wrangling skills to understand some drivers of daily births. Putting these all together can be challenging! Remember the following ways to make tasks more manageable:\n\nTranslate the prompt into our 6 verbs (and count()). That is, think before you type.\nBuild your code line by line. It’s important to understand what’s being piped into each function!\n\n\nExercise 5: Warming up\n\n# How many days of data do we have for each state?\n\n\n# How many total births were there in this time period?\n\n\n# How many total births were there per state in this time period, sorted from low to high?\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Homework Reprise\nCreate a new dataset named daily_births that includes the total number of births per day (across all states) and the corresponding day of the week, eg, Mon. NOTE: Name the column with total births so that it’s easier to wrangle and plot.\nUsing this data, construct a plot of births over time, indicating the day of week.\n\n\nExercise 7: Wrangle & Plot\nFor each prompt below, you can decide whether you want to: (1) wrangle and store data, then plot; or (2) wrangle data and pipe directly into ggplot. For example:\n\npenguins |&gt; \n  filter(species != \"Gentoo\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(y = bill_length_mm, x = bill_depth_mm, color = species)) + \n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nCalculate the total number of births in each month and year, eg, Jan 1969, Feb 1969, …. Label month by names not numbers, eg, Jan not 1. Then, plot the births by month and comment on what you learn.\n\n\nPart b\nIn 1988, calculate the total number of births per week in each state. Get rid of week “53”, which isn’t a complete week! Then, make a line plot of births by week for each state and comment on what you learn. For example, do you notice any seasonal trends? Are these the same in every state? Any outliers?\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat the above for just Minnesota (MN) and Louisiana (LA). MN has one of the coldest climates and LA has one of the warmest. How do their seasonal trends compare? Do you think these trends are similar in other colder and warmer states? Try it!\n\n\n\nExercise 8: More Practice\n\nPart a\nCreate a dataset with only births in Massachusetts (MA) in 1979 and sort the days from those with the most births to those with the fewest.\n\n\nPart b\nMake a table showing the five states with the most births between September 9, 1979 and September 12, 1979, including the 9th and 12th. Arrange the table in descending order of births."

What about in each state? In just the state of Minnesota: Which counties had the highest and lowest Democratic vote in 2020? How did the Democratic vote in each county change from 2016 to 2020?\nGoals of Unit 2: Data Wrangling We really cannot do anything with data (viz, modeling, etc) unless we can wrangle the data. The following is a typical quote. I agree with the 90% – data wrangling isn’t something we have to do before we can do data science, it is data science! But let’s rethink the 10% – data wrangling is a fun and empowering puzzle!\nThe goals of Unit 2 are to explore how to:\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to: keep only certain observations define new variables reformat or “clean” existing variables combine various datasets process “string” or text data Numerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.\nTidyverse Wrangling Tools We’ll continue to use packages that are part of the tidyverse which share a common general grammar and structure.\n8.2 Warm-Up There are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words the 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse each verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\nverb action arrange arrange the rows according to some column filter filter out or obtain a subset of the rows select select a subset of columns mutate mutate or create a column summarize calculate a numerical summary of a column group_by group the rows by a specified column\nEXAMPLE 1\nWhich verb would help us…\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\nget only the data on Minnesota\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\nEXAMPLE 2: select columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\nPipe Function |&gt; |&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\nEXAMPLE 3: filter rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\nfilter(elections, state_name == “Minnesota”)\nelections |&gt; filter(state_name == “Minnesota”)\n== vs = We use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\nx = 2 x\n[1] 2 # Ex: “==” checks whether x is/matches 3 x == 3\n[1] FALSE\nEXAMPLE 4: filter and select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == “Minnesota”)\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == “Minnesota”)\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == “Minnesota”)\nelections[elections$state_name == “Minnesota”, c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\nReflection Why will we typically use:\ntidyverse code the pipe function |&gt; each verb on a new row\nEXAMPLE 5: order of operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters. For example: putting on socks, then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes, then socks. Sometimes order doesn’t matter. For example: Pouring cereal into a bowl, then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bowl, then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == “Minnesota”)\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\nEXAMPLE 6: Storing the results\nTypically:\nWe want to store our data wrangling results. It’s good practice to do so under a new name. We want to preserve, thus don’t want to overwrite, the original data (especially if our code contains errors!!). # Store the results mn &lt;- elections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == “Minnesota”)\nhead(mn)\nstate_name county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16 1 Minnesota Aitkin County 35.98 34.12 2 Minnesota Anoka County 47.79 41.01 3 Minnesota Becker County 33.96 30.47 4 Minnesota Beltrami County 47.24 40.76 5 Minnesota Benton County 32.70 28.33 6 Minnesota Big Stone County 35.41 33.75 nrow(mn)\n[1] 87 nrow(elections)\n[1] 3109 8.3 Exercises Exercise 1: select practice 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nUse select() to create a simplified dataset that we’ll use throughout the exercises below.\nStore this dataset as elections_small.

Let’s practice combining these into pipe series. Here are some hot tips:\nBefore writing any code, translate the prompt: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step? Add each verb one at a time – don’t try writing a whole chunk at once. Part a Show just the counties in Minnesota and their Democratic 2020 vote percentage, from highest to lowest. Your answer should have just 2 columns.\nPart b Create a new dataset named mn_wi that sorts the counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin from lowest to highest in terms of the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016. This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\nPart c Construct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\nExercise 7: summarize demo 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\nReflect Notice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\nExercise 9: DIY Let’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step? Add each verb one at a time. Part a NOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\nPart b # Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020 # HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\nExercise 10: Practice on new data Recall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(“https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv”)\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\nExercise 11: Practice on your data Return to the TidyTuesday data you’re using in Homework 3. Use your new wrangling skills to play around. What new insights can you gain?!\n8.4 Solutions Click for Solutions 7 Effective Viz 9 Wrangling Practice Source Code"

The following is a typical quote. I agree with the 90% – data wrangling isn’t something we have to do before we can do data science, it is data science! But let’s rethink the 10% – data wrangling is a fun and empowering puzzle!\n\nThe goals of Unit 2 are to explore how to:\n\nGet data into the tidy shape / format we need for analysis. For example, we might want to:\n\nkeep only certain observations\ndefine new variables\nreformat or “clean” existing variables\ncombine various datasets\nprocess “string” or text data\n\nNumerically (not just visually) explore and summarize various characteristics of the variables in our dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidyverse Wrangling Tools\nWe’ll continue to use packages that are part of the tidyverse which share a common general grammar and structure."

    "text": "93.2 Warm-Up\nThere are lots and lots of steps that can go into data wrangling, thus lots and lots of relevant R functions. BUT just 6 functions can get us very far. People refer to these as the 6 main wrangling verbs or functions:\n\nwhy “verbs”? in the tidyverse grammar, functions serve as action words\nthe 6 verbs are all stored in the dplyr package within the tidyverse\neach verb acts on a data frame and returns a data frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nverb\naction\n\n\n\n\narrange\narrange the rows according to some column\n\n\nfilter\nfilter out or obtain a subset of the rows\n\n\nselect\nselect a subset of columns\n\n\nmutate\nmutate or create a column\n\n\nsummarize\ncalculate a numerical summary of a column\n\n\ngroup_by\ngroup the rows by a specified column\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\nWhich verb would help us…\n\nkeep only information about state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support (not the 2012 results, demographics, etc)\nget only the data on Minnesota\ndefine a new variable which calculates the change in Democratic support from 2016 to 2020, using dem_pct_20 and dem_pct_16\nsort the counties from highest to lowest Democratic support\ndetermine the total number of votes cast across all counties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2: select columns\nTo get a sense for the code structure, let’s explore a couple verbs together. To start, let’s simplify our dataset to include only some variables of interest. Specifically, select() only the columns relevant to state names, county names, and the 2020 and 2016 Democratic support:\n\n# What's the first argument? The second?\nselect(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16))\n\nLet’s re-do this with the pipe function |&gt;:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipe Function |&gt;\n\n\n\n|&gt; “passes” objects, usually datasets, to a function:\nobject |&gt; function() is the same as function(object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3: filter rows\nLet’s filter() out only the rows related to Minnesota (MN):\n\n# Without a pipe\nfilter(elections, state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With a pipe\nelections |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n== vs =\n\n\n\nWe use a == b to check whether a matches b.\nWe use a = b to define that a is equal to b. We typically use = for this purpose inside a function, and &lt;- for this purpose outside a function.\n\n# Ex: \"=\" defines x\nx = 2\nx\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n# Ex: \"==\" checks whether x is/matches 3\nx == 3\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4: filter and select\nLet’s combine select() and filter() to create a new dataset with info about the county names, and 2020 and 2016 Democratic support among Minnesota counties.\n\n# Without pipes\nfilter(select(elections, c(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16)), state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: all verbs in 1 row\nelections |&gt; select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# With pipes: each verb in a new row\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n\n# We can even do this with UN-tidyverse code in \"base\" R\nelections[elections$state_name == \"Minnesota\", c(1, 4, 8, 12)]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\n\n\n\nWhy will we typically use:\n\ntidyverse code\nthe pipe function |&gt;\neach verb on a new row\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: order of operations\nSometimes, the order of operations matters. For example: putting on socks, then shoes produces a different result than putting on shoes, then socks. Sometimes order doesn’t matter. For example: Pouring cereal into a bowl, then adding milk produces the same result as pouring milk into a bowl, then adding cereal (though one order is obviously better than the other ;)) Above (also copied below), we selected some columns and then filtered some rows:\n\nelections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\nWould we get the same result if we reversed select() and filter()? Think first, then try it.\n\n# Try it\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: Storing the results\nTypically:\n\nWe want to store our data wrangling results.\nIt’s good practice to do so under a new name. We want to preserve, thus don’t want to overwrite, the original data (especially if our code contains errors!!).\n\n\n# Store the results\nmn &lt;- elections |&gt; \n  select(state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16) |&gt; \n  filter(state_name == \"Minnesota\")\n\n# Always check it out to confirm it's what you want it to be!\nhead(mn)\n\n  state_name      county_name dem_pct_20 dem_pct_16\n1  Minnesota    Aitkin County      35.98      34.12\n2  Minnesota     Anoka County      47.79      41.01\n3  Minnesota    Becker County      33.96      30.47\n4  Minnesota  Beltrami County      47.24      40.76\n5  Minnesota    Benton County      32.70      28.33\n6  Minnesota Big Stone County      35.41      33.75\n\nnrow(mn)\n\n[1] 87\n\nnrow(elections)\n\n[1] 3109"

    "text": "93.3 Exercises\n\nExercise 1: select practice\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nUse select() to create a simplified dataset that we’ll use throughout the exercises below.\n\nStore this dataset as elections_small.\nOnly keep the following variables: state_name, county_name, total_votes_20, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, total_votes_16, dem_pct_16\n\n\n# Define elections_small\n#___ &lt;- ___ |&gt;\n#  ___(___)\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your code did what you think it did!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: filter demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nWhereas select() selects certain variables or columns, filter() keeps certain units of observation or rows relative to their outcome on certain variables. To this end, we must:\n\nIdentify the variable(s) that are relevant to the filter.\nUse a “logical comparison operator” to define which values of the variable to keep:\n\n\n\nsymbol\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\n==\nequal to\n\n\n!=\nnot equal to\n\n\n&gt;\ngreater than\n\n\n&gt;=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;\nless than\n\n\n&lt;=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n%in% c(???, ???)\na list of multiple values\n\n\n\nUse quotes \"\" when specifying outcomes of interest for a categorical variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommenting/Uncommenting Code\n\n\n\nTo comment/uncomment several lines of code at once, highlight them then click ctrl/cmd+shift+c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Hawaii\n# elections_small |&gt;\n#  filter(___ ___ ___)\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name %in% c(\"Hawaii\", \"Delaware\"))\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got MORE THAN 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# THINK: What variable is relevant here?\n\n\n# Keep only data on counties where the Republican got AT LEAST 93.97% of the vote in 2020\n# This should have 1 more row than your answer above\n\nWe can also filter with respect to 2 rules! Here, think what variables are relevant.\n\n# Keep only data on counties in Texas where the Democrat got more than 65% of the vote in 2020\n# Do this 2 ways.\n# Method 1: 2 filters with 1 condition each\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  filter(___) |&gt; \n#  filter(___)\n\n# Method 2: 1 filter with 2 conditions\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  filter(___, ___)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: arrange demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\narrange() arranges or sorts the rows in a dataset according to a given column or variable, in ascending or descending order:\narrange(variable), arrange(desc(variable))\n\n# Arrange the counties in elections_small from lowest to highest percentage of 2020 Republican support\n# Print out just the first 6 rows\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   arrange(___) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# Arrange the counties in elections_small from highest to lowest percentage of 2020 Republican support\n# Print out just the first 6 rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: mutate demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nmutate() can either transform / mutate an existing variable (column), or define a new variable based on existing ones.\n\nPart a\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(diff_20 = repub_pct_20 - dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_votes_20 = round(total_votes_20 * repub_pct_20/100)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n# What did this code do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n\nPart b\n\n# You try\n# Define a variable that calculates the change in Dem support in 2020 vs 2016\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  mutate(_____) |&gt; \n#  head()\n\n\n# You try\n# Define a variable that determines whether the Dem support was higher in 2020 than in 2016 (TRUE/FALSE)\n#elections_small |&gt; \n#  mutate(_____) |&gt; \n#  head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Pipe series\nLet’s now combine these verbs into a pipe series!\n\nPart a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE running the below chunk, what do you think it will produce?\n\n\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Wisconsin\",\n#          repub_pct_20 &lt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   arrange(desc(total_votes_20)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n\nPart b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE trying, what do you think will happen if you change the order of filter and arrange:\n\nthe results will be the same\nwe’ll get an error\nwe won’t get an error, but the results will be different\n\n\n\n\n# Now try it. Change the order of filter and arrange below.\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Wisconsin\",\n#          repub_pct_20 &lt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   arrange(desc(total_votes_20)) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\n\n\nPart c\nSo the order of filter() and arrange() did not matter – rerranging them produces the same results. BUT what is one advantage of filtering before arranging?\n\n\nPart d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE running the below chunk, what do you think it will produce?\n\n\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Delaware\") |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   select(county_name, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, repub_win_20)\n\n\n\nPart e\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink then Run\n\n\n\nBEFORE trying, what do you think will happen if you change the order of mutate and select:\n\nthe results will be the same\nwe’ll get an error\nwe won’t get an error, but the results will be different\n\n\n\n\n# Now try it. Change the order of mutate and select below.\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   filter(state_name == \"Delaware\") |&gt; \n#   mutate(repub_win_20 = repub_pct_20 &gt; dem_pct_20) |&gt; \n#   select(county_name, repub_pct_20, dem_pct_20, repub_win_20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: DIY pipe series\nWe’ve now learned 4 of the 6 wrangling verbs: select, filter, mutate, arrange. Let’s practice combining these into pipe series. Here are some hot tips:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the prompt: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time – don’t try writing a whole chunk at once.\n\n\n\nPart a\nShow just the counties in Minnesota and their Democratic 2020 vote percentage, from highest to lowest. Your answer should have just 2 columns.\n\nPart b\nCreate a new dataset named mn_wi that sorts the counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin from lowest to highest in terms of the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016. This dataset should include the following variables (and only these variables): state_name, county_name, dem_pct_20, dem_pct_16, and a variable measuring the change in Democratic vote percentage in 2020 vs 2016.\n\n# Define the dataset\n# Only store the results once you're confident that they're correct\n\n\n# Check out the first 6 rows to confirm your results\n\n\n\nPart c\nConstruct and discuss a plot of the county-level change in Democratic vote percent in 2020 vs 2016, and how this differs between Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: summarize demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nLet’s talk about the last 2 verbs. summarize() (or equivalently summarise()) takes an entire data frame as input and outputs a single row with one or more summary statistics. For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n\n# What does this do?\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\n6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   head()\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   class()\n# \n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   class()\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n# elections_small |&gt; \n#   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n#   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble! But the units of observation are now states instead of counties within states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: DIY\nLet’s practice (some of) our 6 verbs: select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by Remember:\n\nBefore writing any code, translate the given prompts: how many distinct wrangling steps are needed and what verb do we need in each step?\nAdd each verb one at a time.\n\n\nPart a\nNOTE: Part a is a challenge exercise. If you get really stuck, move on to Part b which is the same overall question, but with hints.\n\n# Sort the *states* from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each *state*?\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n\n\n\nPart b\n\n# Sort the states from the most to least total votes cast in 2020\n# HINT: Calculate the total number of votes in each state, then sort\n\n\n# In 2020, what were the total number of votes for the Democratic candidate and the total number of votes for the Republican candidate in each state?\n# HINT: First calculate the number of Dem and Repub votes in each *county*\n# Then group and summarize these by state\n\n\n# What states did the Democratic candidate win in 2020?\n# HINT: Start with the results from the previous chunk, and then keep only some rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Practice on new data\nRecall the World Cup football/soccer data from TidyTuesday:\n\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nYou can find a codebook here. Use (some of) our 6 verbs (select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarize, group_by) and data viz to address the following prompts.\n\n# In what years did Brazil win the World Cup?\n\n\n# What were the 6 World Cups with the highest attendance?\n\n\n# Construct a univariate plot of goals_scored (no wrangling necessary)\n# This provides a visual summary of how the number of goals_scored varies from World Cup to World Cup\n\n\n# Let's follow up the plot with some more precise numerical summaries\n# Calculate the min, median, and max number of goals_scored across all World Cups\n# NOTE: Visually compare these numerical summaries to what you observed in the plot\n\n\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the number of goals_scored in the World Cup has changed over the years\n# No wrangling necessary\n\n\n# Our above summaries might be a bit misleading.\n# The number of games played at the World Cup varies.\n# Construct a bivariate plot of how the typical number of goals per game has changed over the years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11: Practice on your data\nReturn to the TidyTuesday data you’re using in Homework 3. Use your new wrangling skills to play around. What new insights can you gain?!"

Since penguin_avg is small, we could do these calculations by hand. But this doesn’t scale up to bigger datasets.\n\nSketch out (on paper, in your head, anything) how this data would need to be reshaped, without losing any information, in order to calculate the differences in average body mass using our wrangling verbs. Make it as specific as possible, with column labels, entries, correct numbers, etc.\nIdentify the units of observation.\n\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider vs Longer formats\nMaking our data longer or wider reshapes the data, changing the units of observation while retaining all raw information:\n\nMake the data longer, i.e. combine values from multiple variables into 1 variable. EXAMPLE: 1999 and 2000 represent two years. We want to combine their results into 1 variable without losing any information.\n\n\n\nMake the data wider, i.e. spread out the values across new variables. EXAMPLE: cases and pop represent two categories within type. To compare or combine their count outcomes side-by-side, we can separate them into their own variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: pivot wider\nBecause it’s a small enough dataset to examine all at once, let’s start with our penguin_avg data:\n\npenguin_avg\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\nWith the goal of being able to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species, let’s make the dataset wider. That is, let’s get one row per species with separate columns for the average body mass by sex. Put this code into a chunk and run it:\npenguin_avg |&gt; pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Wider\n\n\n\n\nnames_from = the variable whose values we want to separate into their own columns, i.e. where we want to get the new column names from\nvalues_from = which variable to take the new column values from\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation?\nDid we lose any information when we widened the data?\nUse the wide data to calculate the difference in average body mass, male vs female, for each species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: Pivot longer\nLet’s store our wide data:\n\npenguin_avg_wide &lt;- penguin_avg |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = avg_body_mass)\n\npenguin_avg_wide\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   female  male\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie     3369. 4043.\n2 Chinstrap  3527. 3939.\n3 Gentoo     4680. 5485.\n\n\nSuppose we wanted to change this data back to a longer format. In general, this happens when some variables (here female and male) represent two categories or values of some broader variable (here sex), and we want to combine them into that 1 variable without losing any information. Let’s pivot_longer():\n\n# We can either communicate which variables we WANT to collect into a single column (female, male)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(female, male), names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n# Or which variable(s) we do NOT want to collect into a single column (sex)\npenguin_avg_wide |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = -species, names_to = \"sex\", values_to = \"avg_body_mass\")\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   species [3]\n  species   sex    avg_body_mass\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Adelie    female         3369.\n2 Adelie    male           4043.\n3 Chinstrap female         3527.\n4 Chinstrap male           3939.\n5 Gentoo    female         4680.\n6 Gentoo    male           5485.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPivot Longer\n\n\n\n\ncols = the columns (variables) to collect into a single, new variable. we can also specify what variables we don’t want to collect\nnames_to = the name of the new variable which will include the names or labels of the collected variables\nvalues_to = the name of the new variable which will include the values of the collected variables\n\n\n\nFOLLOW-UP:\n\nWhat are the units of observation?\nDid we lose any information when we lengthened the data?\nWhy did we put the variables in quotes “” here but not when we used pivot_wider()?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7: Practice\nLet’s make up some data on the orders of 2 different customers at 3 different restaurants:\n\nfood &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 3),\n  restaurant = rep(c(\"Shish\", \"FrenchMeadow\", \"DunnBros\"), 2),\n  order = c(\"falafel\", \"salad\", \"coffee\", \"baklava\", \"pastry\", \"tea\")\n)\nfood\n\n  customer   restaurant   order\n1        A        Shish falafel\n2        A FrenchMeadow   salad\n3        A     DunnBros  coffee\n4        B        Shish baklava\n5        B FrenchMeadow  pastry\n6        B     DunnBros     tea\n\n\nThe units of observation in food are customer / restaurant combinations. Wrangle this data so that the units of observation are customers, spreading the restaurants into separate columns.\nConsider 2 more customers:\n\nmore_food &lt;- data.frame(\n  customer = c(\"C\", \"D\"),\n  Shish = c(\"coffee\", \"maza\"),\n  FrenchMeadow = c(\"soup\", \"sandwich\"),\n  DunnBros = c(\"cookie\", \"coffee\")\n)\nmore_food\n\n  customer  Shish FrenchMeadow DunnBros\n1        C coffee         soup   cookie\n2        D   maza     sandwich   coffee\n\n\nWrangle this data so that the 3 restaurant columns are combined into 1, hence the units of observation are customer / restaurant combinations."

The units of observation is the reaction time every day of each participants.\n\n\nPart b\nSuppose I ask you to plot each subject’s reaction time (y-axis) vs the number of days of sleep restriction (x-axis). “Sketch” out in words what the first few rows of the data need to look like in order to do this. It might help to think about what you’d need to complete the plotting frame:\nggplot(sleep_wide, aes(y = time, x = day, color = subject))\nBut we don’t have a column for day.\n\n\nPart c\nHow can you obtain the dataset you sketched in part b?\n\njust using sleep_wide\npivot_longer()\npivot_wider()\n\nBy using ‘pivot_longer()’ to generate all ‘day_0’ to ‘day_9’ to one column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Pivot longer\nTo plot reaction time by day for each subject, we need to reshape the data into a long format where each row represents a subject/day combination. Specifically, we want a dataset with 3 columns and a first few rows that look something like this:\n\n\n\nSubject\nday\nreaction_time\n\n\n\n\n308\n0\n249.56\n\n\n308\n1\n258.70\n\n\n308\n2\n250.80\n\n\n\n\nPart a\nUse pivot_longer() to create the long-format dataset above. Show the first 3 lines (head(3)), which should be similar to those above. Follow-up: Thinking forward to plotting reaction time vs day for each subject, what would you like to fix / change about this dataset?\n\n# For cols, try 2 appproaches: using - and starts_with\n# sleep_wide |&gt; \n#   pivot_longer(cols = -Subject, names_to = \"day\", values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\n\n\nPart b\nRun this chunk:\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\")\n\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject day   reaction_time\n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     308 0              250.\n2     308 1              259.\n3     308 2              251.\n4     308 3              321.\n5     308 4              357.\n6     308 5              415.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nBesides putting each argument on a different line for readability and storing the results, what changed in the code?\nHow did this impact how the values are recorded in the day column?\n\n\n\nPart c\nUsing sleep_long, construct a line plot of reaction time vs day for each subject. This will look goofy no matter what you do. Why? HINT: look back at head(sleep_long). What class or type of variables are Subject and day? What do we want them to be?\n\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color = Subject))+\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Changing variable classes & plotting\nLet’s finalize sleep_long by mutating the Subject variable to be a factor (categorical) and the day variable to be numeric (quantitative). Take note of the mutate() code! You’ll use this type of code a lot.\n\nsleep_long &lt;- sleep_wide |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject,\n               names_to = \"day\",\n               names_prefix = \"day_\",\n               values_to = \"reaction_time\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Subject = as.factor(Subject), day = as.numeric(day))\n\n# Check it out\n# Same data, different class\nhead(sleep_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject   day reaction_time\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 308         0          250.\n2 308         1          259.\n3 308         2          251.\n4 308         3          321.\n5 308         4          357.\n6 308         5          415.\n\n\n\nPart a\nNow make some plots.\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on the same frame\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day, color = Subject))+\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Make a line plot of reaction time by day for each subject\n# Put these all on separate frames (one per subject)\nggplot(sleep_long, aes(y = reaction_time, x = day))+\n  geom_line()+\n  facet_wrap(~Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize what you learned from the plots. For example:\n\nWhat’s the general relationship between reaction time and sleep?\nIs this the same for everybody? What differs?\n\nMostly, the more days the participants get only 3 hours sleep, the longer their reaction time is.

There are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHints:\n\nShould you first pivot wider or longer?\nOnce you pivot, the week number is turned into a character variable. How can you change it to a number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: Practice with the Daily Show\nThe data associated with this article is available in the fivethirtyeight package, and is loaded into daily below. It includes a list of every guest to ever appear on Jon Stewart’s The Daily Show, a “late-night talk and satirical news” program (per Wikipedia). Check out the dataset and note that when multiple people appeared together, each person receives their own line:\n\nlibrary(fivethirtyeight)\ndata(\"daily_show_guests\")\ndaily &lt;- daily_show_guests\n\nIn analyzing this data, you’ll need to determine if and when the data needs to be reshaped.\n\nPart a\nIdentify the 15 guests that appeared the most. (This isn’t a very diverse guest list!)\n\n\nPart b\nCHALLENGE: Create the following data set containing 19 columns:\n\nThe first column should have the 15 guests with the highest number of total appearances on the show, listed in descending order of number of appearances.\n17 columns should show the number of appearances of the corresponding guest in each year from 1999 to 2015 (one per column).\nAnother column should show the total number of appearances for the corresponding guest over the entire duration of the show.\n\nThere are hints below (if you scroll), but you’re encouraged to play around and use as few hints as possible.\nHINTS: There are lots of ways to do this. You don’t necessarily need all of these hints.\n\nFirst obtain the number of times a guest appears each year.\nTo this, add a new column which includes the total number of times a guest appears across all years.\nPivot (longer or wider?). When you do, use values_fill = 0 to replace NA values with 0.\nArrange, then and keep the top 15.\n\n\n\nPart c\nLet’s recreate the first figure from the article. This groups all guests into 3 broader occupational categories. However, our current data has 18 categories:\n\ndaily |&gt; \n  count(group)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 2\n   group              n\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Academic         103\n 2 Acting           930\n 3 Advocacy          24\n 4 Athletics         52\n 5 Business          25\n 6 Clergy             8\n 7 Comedy           150\n 8 Consultant        18\n 9 Government        40\n10 Media            751\n11 Military          16\n12 Misc              45\n13 Musician         123\n14 Political Aide    36\n15 Politician       308\n16 Science           28\n17 media              5\n18 &lt;NA&gt;              31\n\n\nLet’s define a new dataset that includes a new variable, broad_group, that buckets these 18 categories into the 3 bigger ones used in the article. And get rid of any rows missing information on broad_group. You’ll learn the code soon! For now, just run this chunk:\n\nplot_data &lt;- daily |&gt; \n  mutate(broad_group = case_when(\n    group %in% c(\"Acting\", \"Athletics\", \"Comedy\", \"Musician\") ~ \"Acting, Comedy & Music\",\n    group %in% c(\"Media\", \"media\", \"Science\", \"Academic\", \"Consultant\", \"Clergy\") ~ \"Media\",\n    group %in% c(\"Politician\", \"Political Aide\", \"Government\", \"Military\", \"Business\", \"Advocacy\") ~ \"Government and Politics\",\n    .default = NA\n  )) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(broad_group))\n\nNow, using the broad_group variable in plot_data, recreate the graphic from the article, with three different lines showing the fraction of guests in each group over time. Note: You’ll have to wrangle the data first."
